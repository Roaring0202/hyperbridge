## Hyperbridge Fees

Hyperbridge fees is charged from "Hyperbridge bridge messging as a service" stand point, Applications interoping using Hyperbridge
pays `$0.003` per bytes of a request.

### Example

Using a snippet of code from the `TokenGatway` contract, this is a how fees are estimated;

```solidity
    struct Body {
        // amount to be sent
        uint256 amount;
        // The token identifier
        bytes32 tokenId;
        // flag to redeem the erc20 asset on the destination
        bool redeem;
        // sender address
        address from;
        // recipient address
        address to;
    }
    bytes memory data = abi.encode(
        Body({from: from, to: params.to, amount: params.amount, tokenId: params.tokenId, redeem: params.redeem})
    );
    DispatchPost memory request = DispatchPost({
        dest: params.dest,
        to: abi.encodePacked(address(this)),
        // add enum variant for body
        body: bytes.concat(hex"00", data),
        timeout: params.timeout,
        fee: params.fee,
        gaslimit: uint64(0),
        payer: msg.sender
    });
    // Your money is now on its way
    IDispatcher(_host).dispatch(request);

```

In `DispatchPost`, this property that influences fees been paid is the `body` property, in the example above, 
the `body` property is `bytes.concat(hex"00", data)`, the `data` is the `Body` struct that contains the `amount`, 
`tokenId`, `redeem`, `from` and `to` properties. These are information the `TokenGatway` contract needs to execute
asset bridging.

In the example above the fee that would be paid can be estimated by calculating the length of the `data` [160 bytes] and multiplying it by `$0.003`
evaulating to `$0.48`.
